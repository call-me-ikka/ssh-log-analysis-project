# SSH Log Analysis & Incident Reporting

## Project Description
This is a beginner-level cyber security project performed using Kali Linux.
The goal of this project is to identify suspicious SSH login attempts
and detect possible brute-force attacks by analyzing authentication logs.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Linux Terminal
- auth.log

## What I Did

- Prepared an incident report with security recommendations

## Sample Log Evidence
Screenshots of terminal output showing failed and successful SSH login attempts
are included as proof of analysis.

## Skills Gained
- Linux log analysis
- SSH security basics
- Incident identification
- Report writing
